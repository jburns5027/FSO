<p>     I chose this story because it was an event that is fresh in my mind.  I recently went on a buisness trip for work, and had to pack for a long flight.
I am aperson that usually over thinks things, so packing for a trip wasn't going to be any different.</p>
<p>     Parts of my code, like socks >=10 is all about weather or not I packed parts of my clothing that changes per day.  Such as socks.  Ineed at least one pair of scks, boxers, jeans, and shirst for each day. I like to pack atleast one or two extra pairs
of item just in case of an accident.  In my case it was needed.  About two days in, I spilled coffee in my lap riding in the back seat of the rental car myself and other co-workers had.</p>
<p>     I had also taken into account the long flight, and under packing was not an option. Things like does the plan have wi-fi, should I bring a book, a magazine, music or all three?  So I packed all three. Did I use all of them? No
Did the plan have wi-fi? No.  I still think over packing is better then under packing.</p>
