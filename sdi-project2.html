<p>          I had changed this week's story for a couple of reasons.  The first was simply; the purchase of my new headphones had only taken that one trip to the trading post.
There isn't much more then that.  My weight loss journey is going to go on for the rest of my life.  It's not a diet that I went on for a period of time, and then ended the diet,
it is a "Lifestyle Change".  I had to retrain the way my mind thought about exercise, and the food I take in. </p>
<p>        This week talks about what I do every day.  Before my running shoes go on, I have the weather on the brain.  Is it raining, snowing, cold, hot, can I run outside, or am I stuck inside.
 If the conditions are right, I run outside, and love every minute.  If the conditions are not right, I'm stuck running on a treadmill, happy that I'm getting an exercise in for the day.</p>
<p>        After that, I throw on the running shoes, put my iPhone in my arm band, turn on the music, and c2,5K app, and take off down the street, or on one treadmill platform staying in the same spot for an hour.
 I listen and fallow along to the training app. I run when she says run, and I walk when she says walk.
<p>     Afterword's I know it is very important to use static stretches to loosen up my muscles.  Running is an exercise that I enjoy, and I know that if someone cannot find an exercise that they enjoy, they will never stick to it.
So I take stretching very seriously. I don't want my running to be hindered, because of an injury due to lack of stretching.  </p>
